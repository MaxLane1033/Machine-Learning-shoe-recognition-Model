# Machine Learning Shoe Recognition Model

A PyTorch-based image classification model that can distinguish between Nike and Adidas shoes. This project demonstrates computer vision techniques for brand recognition in footwear.

## Features

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Data augmentation for improved generalization
- Training and validation loops with metrics tracking
- Model saving and loading functionality
- Simple inference script for testing

## Performance

The model achieves good accuracy on the validation set. Performance can be improved by:
- Using more training data
- Implementing transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters
- Using more sophisticated data augmentation
